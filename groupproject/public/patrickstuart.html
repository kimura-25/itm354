<p>Patrick graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance from the Shidler College of Business, University of Hawaii at Manoa. He later completed his Master of Business and Master of Arts, Human Resource Management from Hawaii Pacific University, while working at Northwest Airlines and traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. In 1999, Patrick joined Prince Resorts Hawaii, Mauna Kea Resort, as Associate Human Resources Manager where he was able to assist employees with a wide range of employment issues and needs.

</p>

<p>Most recently, he was Human Resources Manager for Remedy Intelligent Staffing, a full service staffing company, in which he focused on recruitment, placement, benefits, employee relations and employee development. In this role, Patrick was able to specifically consult with companies on their staffing needs and assist them with locating qualified candidates for their consideration. Alternatively, he was able to assist candidates with job skill identification to develop their foundations, and ultimately, identify potential career paths.

</p>

<p>Patrick looks forward to working with the Shidler College of Business students, specifically, Undergraduates, in assisting them with building their foundations through internships and ultimately placement in top companies, locally, nationally, and internationally.
